## description of your application.
# application
The basic purpose of this code is to grade assignments automatically depending on different variables such as time of submission, etc. This application can be utilized in schools, colleges, or any other platforms where students are involved and grading is required.
# steps for makeing my application
At first, I tried to create a separate function and put my logic in it, but that just made my code inefficient and basically looked pointless. So then I put all of my logic in getLearnerData by erasing the dummy data in it. This made more sense to me.

My first priority while making the application was to ensure that my code runs. Once my code ran, no matter how, only then did I start putting extra stuff in it which were requirements of SBA such as try/catch, else, continue, two different loops (I only used one type initially), etc.

The hardest thing I found while making this application was obviously logic, but also I found making this application dynamic extremely difficult. At first, I couldn't fully understand the requirements of the project, so that took me a while. Once I did understand it, I started to code, but my application was extremely static, which also made my code very easy. At that point, I thought to myself, "This is too good to be true." Then I started making my code dynamic (which I found the most difficult).

The commented-out lines are just the past mistakes I made, so I just commented them out and changed my code every time to write a new logic.
